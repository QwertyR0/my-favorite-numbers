why? _**cuz yes**_

## <br/>**the thing is simple:**<br/>
first you declare your first number which is **3** for me
and then you add the number with itself **3+3=6** and then add 1 to that number **6+1=7** that you got it is 7 for me then **7+7=14** but this time subtract 1 from it **14-1=13** then repeat.
